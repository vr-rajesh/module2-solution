                    Try to use day-old rice: Fried rice is usually a dish that you make to repurpose the leftover cooked rice from the day before. You want to avoid freshly cooked rice because it is still moist and steamy, which may yield fried rice with a mushy texture. (Notice in the photo below how you can see individual grains of rice instead of a mushy mass of rice.) However, if you forget about cooking rice the day before, here is a little trick that I use. I spread a layer freshly cooked rice onto large baking sheets and let the rice air out for about 1 to 2 hours, the longer the better. The grains of rice will dry out during this process.

                    In a large bowl, beat eggs on high speed for 5 minutes or until thick and lemon-colored. Gradually add sugar, beating until mixture is light and fluffy. Beat in vanilla. Combine flour and baking powder; gradually add to batter; beat at low speed until smooth.
                    In a small saucepan, heat milk and butter just until butter is melted. Gradually add to batter; beat just until combined.
                    Pour into a greased 13x9-in. baking pan. Bake at 350Â° for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
